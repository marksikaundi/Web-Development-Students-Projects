        I'm Steven Lukanga Aged 20 curently staying in the Capital City of Zambia Lusaka. 
         I grow up in the land of Kitwe in the Copperbelts where i started my Primary School which was in 2002,
        i had a bad perfomers in class not until i realized to say it was beacuse of peer pressure and i would
         always be sitting at the back as a back bencher.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        From the time i just got to change in the sitting position and the friends i used to be found with my
        performs now changed and i was able to get the best results.
        The time i went to do my secondary School which was in 2009 when i was in Grade 8 my dream was to be
        the best student at Mukuba Boys Secondary School which has being the best School in the Copperbelts 
        and one of my dream Schools. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I didn't start my Grade 8 well,which made me to fail my final Exams in Grade 9,so i had to sit for 
        Exams again which was in 2010 and i sat for my final exams for the secomd time and i was able to pass 
        this time around.

    </p>

    <p>
        I manage to reach Grade 12 with good results and perfommance,there after i even wrote my final exams 
        in 2013 of which i was the second highest student in that year.Even before i applied to the University 
        i went by DK where i did my A levels to easily upragde and by this time i had to relocate to Lusaka. 
        Before i was done with A levels i Applied at Kabwata Skills Development Center where i started studing 
        Computer Studies.
